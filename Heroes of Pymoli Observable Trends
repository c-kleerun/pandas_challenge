After reviewing the data from Heroes of Pymoli, there are various trends we can observe in the data. Some of the observed trends include:

1 - Male players make up the greatest percentage of players (84.03%) but their average purchase price was lower than the female and other/non-disclosed player groups.
    However, this difference was only a few cents ($0.18 less than the female group and $0.33 less than the other/non-disclosed), and may not have any bearing on overall 
    profits.
2 - The players making the most purchases (44.79% of all purchases) fall in the 20-24 age range. It would be interesting to see if this trend continues across other 
    genres of games, indicating that this particular age range enjoys all game genres, or if there is a preference for fantasy genres. This could inform which types of
    games are given the green-light in the future.
3 - There seems to be a correlation between the most popular and most profitable items in the game. The items 'Final Critic', 'Oathbreaker', and 'Fiery Glass Crusader' were
    among the top five both categories. It would be interesting to look closer at the items and perhaps poll purchasers as to why they chose to purchase the items. This 
    information may be helpful in creating other popular items to help increase revenue.
